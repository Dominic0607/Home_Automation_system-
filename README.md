# Home_Automation_system-
Home Automation is a convenient way to control and monitor different day to day devices and appliance that we use at home. These include held lighting, air conditioning, garage doors, security cameras, motion sensors, energy control units and whether sensors as well. Home automation solutions largely vary depending up on the functionality and scope.This project is completely build on Proteus Professional 8 simulator.All the required libraries are given in files.

#Requirements :
1. Arduino UNO 
2. Relay’s 
3. DC motor
4. LED (Red & Green) 
5. Lamp
6. Proteus Professional 8
7. Arduino Ide

#Schematic (Simulation):  
Input voltage to Arduino is given from external power source. Digital output pin 11,12,13 are connected to three relay’s. Output of Relay (R1) is connected to input of Lamp. Output of Relay (R2) is connected to input of DC Motor. Output of Relay (R3) is connected to input of LED’s.
